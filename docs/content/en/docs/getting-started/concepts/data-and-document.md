## Data Format and Document Model

Fleather document model exists as a separate platform-agnostic library
called Parchment. Parchment implements all building blocks of a rich text
document and can be used separately from Fleather on any platform
supported by Dart SDK, e.g. web, desktop or server (macos, windows,
linux) and, of course, mobile (ios, android).

Parchment documents are based on Quill.js [Delta][] format. Deltas are
simple and expressive format of describing rich text data, and is also
suitable for [Operational transformations][ot]. The format is
essentially JSON, and is human readable.

> Official implementation of Delta format is written in
> [JavaScript][github-delta] but it was ported to Dart and is available
> on [Pub][pub-delta]. Examples in this document use Dart syntax.

### Deltas quick start

All Deltas consist of three operations: `insert`, `delete` and `retain`. The
example below describes the string "Karl the Fog" where "Karl" is bolded
and "Fog" is italic:

```dart
var delta = new Delta();
delta
  ..insert('Karl', {'bold': true})
  ..insert(' the ')
  ..insert('Fog', {'italic': true});
print(json.encode(delta));
// Prints:
// [
//   {"insert":"Karl","attributes":{"bold":true}},
//   {"insert":" the "},
//   {"insert":"Fog","attributes":{"italic":true}}
// ]
```

Above delta is usually also called "document delta" because it consists
of only `insert` operations.

Below example describes a *change* where "Fog" gets also styled as bold:

```dart
var delta = new Delta();
delta..retain(9)..retain(3, {'bold': true});
print(json.encode(delta));
// Prints:
// [{"retain":9},{"retain":3,"attributes":{"bold":true}}]
```

A simple way to visualize a change is as if it moves an imaginary cursor
and applies modifications on the way. So with the above example, the
first `retain` operation moves the cursor forward 9 characters. Then,
second operation moves cursor additional 3 characters forward but also
applies bold style to each character it passes.

The Delta library provides a way of composing such changes into documents
or transforming against each other. E.g.:

```dart
var doc = new Delta();
doc
  ..insert('Karl', {'bold': true})
  ..insert(' the ')
  ..insert('Fog', {'italic': true});
var change = new Delta();
change..retain(9)..retain(3, {'bold': true});
var updatedDoc = doc.compose(change);
print(json.encode(updatedDoc));
// Prints:
//  [
//    {"insert":"Karl","attributes":{"bold":true}},
//    {"insert":" the "},
//    {"insert":"Fog","attributes":{"italic":true,"bold":true}}
//  ]
```

These are the basics of Deltas. Read [official documentation][delta-docs]
for more details.

### Document model

Parchment documents are represented as a tree of nodes. There are 3 main
types of nodes:

* `LeafNode` - a leaf node which represents a segment of styled text within a document. There are two kinds of leaf nodes - text and embeds.
* `LineNode` - represents an individual line of text within a document. Line nodes are containers for leaf nodes.
* `Block` - represents a group of adjacent lines which share the same style. Examples of blocks include lists, quotes or code blocks.

Given above description, here is ASCII-style visualization of a Parchment
document tree:

```
root
 ╠═ block
 ║   ╠═ line
 ║   ║   ╠═ text
 ║   ║   ╚═ text
 ║   ╚═ line
 ║       ╚═ text
 ╠═ line
 ║   ╚═ text
 ╚═ block
     ╚═ line
         ╠═ text
         ╚═ text
```

It is currently not allowed to nest blocks inside other blocks but this
may change in the future.

All manipulations of Parchment documents are designed strictly to match
semantics of underlying Delta format. As a result the model itself is
fairly simple and predictable.
