But after some time it kind of naturally turned into an almost complete rewrite of the package.

Though there will be an Upgrading Guide when we get closer to the release of 1.0 which should help with migration.\nThe good news is that this version already includes several improvements comparing to the current 0.x version of Fleather package. It now allows to embed the editor into a custom scrollable, make it expanding to fill it's parent and fixes the issue with hintText in FleatherField and InputDecoration.\nPlus it now matches cursor rendering with that of the built-in Flutter text fields.\nAlso code blocks now how line numbers:\nvoid main(List<String> args) {"},{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"block":"code"}},{"insert":"  print(\"This is Fleather Editor\");"},{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"block":"code"}},{"insert":"}"},{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"block":"code"}},{"insert":"Ah, and Fleather has much better support for desktop platforms (tested on macOS only at this point) as well as the Web.
